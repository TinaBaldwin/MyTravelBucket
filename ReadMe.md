My Travel Bucket

This website highlights five places that I'd like to visit. I used the Coolors website to choose my color palette. Pictures for each city were obtained from Unspash. The general facts for each city were found through general internet searches. The website uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website is designed mobile first and has two media queries for tablets and desktop users. The general facts for each city are stored in an array containing city name, best months to visit, a popular attraction, the nickname of the city, and an adjective describing the city. A function was used to iterate over the array and produce the sentences. At the bottom of the website I introduce the user to National Tourism Day, which occurs every May 7th. A Javascript function to used to calculate and display the number of  days left until May 7th for the user to plan their travel. The website also retrieves data from a third party API of famous quotes. A quote is generated upon page load and the user is able to get a new quote by click event/clicking a button. There is also a place for the user to enter their email. Regular Expression (regex) is used to validate the users input is a valid email and the user is notified if the email is valid, invalid or if they have failed to enter anything into the input box. 

This website is not currently hosted. It may be viewed locally on a user's computer by cloning the gitHub repo. Open the project in your browser window for functionality. The Quote API does not require an API key.
